## Schedule tasks

Task assignment and course progress : [ML-learning progress](https://github.com/HUST-IDC/ML-generative-model/projects/1)

Because there are many courses for first-year graduate students, and each person's class schedule is different, the specific meeting time will be notified before the meeting. So please pay attention to the DingTalk group  message.
